I recently had a private training session with Joe Tandle from NYIM.  The overall experience was great.  I feel the instructor was well educated on the tools I needed in order to succeed in my current role.  The pace of the class was wonderful.  It allowed me to ask thoughtful questions on ambiguous material and in return the answers were clear and concise.  The instructor was well- prepared.  He also supplied me with supporting documentation to use at all times.  He even went so far as to provide me the opportunity to call him at anytime in the future if I ever ran into a problem.  Overall, I would rate the preparation, use of time, knowledge of material and general kindness as one of the best training classes/sessions that I have ever attended.  I have and will continue to recommend Joe Tandle and the folks at NYIM to others.	Excel and PowerPoint Private Training	K. Burton of Microsoft Corp.
The instructor was very helpful. He really knows his PowerPoint. I feel that I go the attention I needed. I think it's wonderful to have a smaller class because that way the instructor has more time to spend with the student. New York Interactive Media is the BEST place to take computer classes. I was very impressed with this PowerPoint class.HOORAY!!!! Whatever didn't register in my head is written in black and white in the manual. This makes things more easier for the student. I NEVER had any connection with PowerPoint but today's class has given me a better perspective.	PowerPoint 2007 for Business Group Class	A.G.
Glenn Harris is extremely knowledgable of excel and can TEACH the material. I loved this class; Glenn and five of us. Very intimate, that is what I paid for. His knowledge of excel taught to me and my classmates were great because we all had somthing to add. I even brought up this class on a job interview. Very satisfied!!!

Joe was a wonderful teacher. The pace of the class was great, when someone didn't undestand anything he took the time to fully explain it until everyone got it...no one should feel left behind in his class. I feel like I will walk out of this with the skills/knowledge that I was looking for. I highly recommend taking these classes.	Flash Essentials Group Class	J.F.

Having participated in a private training session for myself and co-worker as opposed to a group setting I found it to be personal and extremely helpful. I didn't feel as if I were lost as can be the case when part of a group. Our instructor, Scott had an excellent knowledge of the material he presented. He was very professional and patient. I would recommend him for any who are interested in Excel training. I appreciated that he was willing to go over the basics in Excel as a refresher before moving to the advanced version.

Our instructor Joe was very good; he answered all of our questions, and really took time with each person to handle their questions and stumbling blocks. The CSS part: it is really going to help me with my business, and my ability to help clients create consistent styles for their websites. The small class size helped: only 5 of us, so we all got our questions answered.	Dreamweaver Essentials 3 dayGroup Class	N.A.

Hi Mary, This is Robert Santry and I am a financial professional here in New York. I attended the Advanced Excel for Business class taught by Glenn Harris. I had recently taken an excel class hosted by another computer training firm and there was really no comparison in the level of expertise that I received through NYIM. Also, Glenn was available to follow up after class with any questions that I had covering class material. Also, he agreed to meet with me after class at my location as well, to assist in various implementations of the material that we covered in class. I was really impressed by his depth of knowledge concerning the material and his willingness to meet after class and make sure what we learned was indelibly imprinted in my excel skill set! I am sure he is an invaluable asset to your firm and to the people who take his class. Kind Regards,	Advanced Excel for Business Group Class 	R.S.
Joy Hoffman was an excellent instructor. She delivered the material in clear succinct ways. She had a great sense of humor and kept the class upbeat even when we were dragging in the afternoon. She helped us to see how much we had learned by reminding us where we had been just the day before. She handled the differences between skill levels of the various participants very well.

The instructor was great. He used the available class time wisely and taught at a reasonable pace.	InDesign Essentials Group Class	M.M.
It was like a very condensed tin of soup - and thick in content, its full benefit is only revealed when you take time afterwards to dilute what you heard by practice, practice, practice. Like all food it has a use-by date, but I have never felt so inclined to put time aside as after this course. To continue the food analogy, it was a healthy and sustaining meal and chef Dan deserves a couple of stars and an accolade.	Photoshop Essentials 3 Day Group Class	R.L.
Scott kept the class interesting, was very responsive to and thorough about answering questions, and I learned a lot. Thanks Scott!	PowerPoint 2003 for Business Group Class	K.T.

I was in one of the basic Illustrator classes and found Mikelle to be knowledgeable, prompt to answer any of my questions and she was actually well versed in the subject. I had taken Illustrator classes previously and I think besides knowing the subject, she has the ability to teach it, especially since the classes were geared to flat sketching for the garment industry. I recommend her highly for basic Illustrator.	Illustrator for the Fashion Industry Private Training	Gustavo of Jones apparel Group
Mikelle has great patience and great practical knowledge! I appreciated her making each project applicable to the fashion industry.	Photoshop & Illustrator for the Fashion Industry Group Class	K.Z.

I really liked the way Eric taught; he put us at ease and had a laidback way of teaching. It seemed things were moving slow but I realized that what was happening was that I was learning every single thing he was teaching, in a really relaxed way - a very refreshing way to learn. Eric was also very patient and kind, and obviously knew a LOT about PowerPoint and computers in general.	PowerPoint for Business Group Class	D.H.
Excellent instruction, professional and understanding of students needs!	Excel for Business Group Class	H.K.
I thought he was EXTREMELY patient and tolerant of my many redundant/silly questions. Couldn't ask for more!!!	Flash Essentials Group Class	S.F.
Joy is super!	Excel & PowerPoint for Business Group Class	K.P.

Hi Mary: I have been meaning to email/call you but I have been so busy that I have not been able to do so until now. I just want to thank you so much. Working with Paul was wonderful. He is a great instructor. I walked away happily, knowing how to prepare a presentation..... Thanks again,	PowerPoint Group & Private Training 	A.B.

Eric really was awesome. Kept everyone's attention...didn't let anyone fall too far behind...communicated extremely well	Excel for Business Group Class 	D.G.
Joe was clear and used the right terms when giving instruction. I find that verbal cues are often the biggest hurdle when talking about operating a computer: click on the box that does that again is the kind of thing that doesn't work, and something Joe avoided well.	Advanced Excel for Business Group Class	T.S.
Personable, knowledgeable, patient, excellent!	PowerPoint for Business Group Class	E.S.
Joe is fantastic!! He is also very knowledgeable when answering questions. A pro.	Photoshop Essentials Group Class	C.V.

Hi Joe, I just wanted to write and say hi and THANK YOU. So Nai and I have been in touch and I interviewed a couple of rounds at Macys and I am now freelancing for a month there. If it works out I think they are going to hire me full time! We shall see but it's really exciting. I thought it would be good advertising for you to be able to say that by taking your classes I not only learned enough to hold my own on illustrator... but I got a job as well! The classes really helped me and I learned a lot. Both Phoenix & Mikelle were great but I think Mikelle's class was definitely more structured and she was a little more knowledgeable about what skills are necessary on the job. I learned a lot of helpful tips. Anyway, I just wanted to thank you for putting me in touch with Nai and for offering the Illustrator/Photoshop classes. Have a great day,	Photoshop/Illustrator for the Fashion Industry Group Class 	J.O.
Joe was great and Outlook training is really helping me at my new job. Learned little things about Outlook that I never used and was able to jump right into things at my new job and use them every day. Thanks again!	Dreamweaver Private Training 	M.L.

NYIM was a pleasure to work with. They did an amazing job at designing our website. All we had to do was give them the color scheme and the basic ideas of the site and Pattie took it from there. I was amazed by not only how the site looked but by how professional and courteous they were. Pattie not only got the site done on time but they were always updating me, available for questions, and returned the answers in a timely fashion. Once the website was done, they hooked it up so I can easily update everything on my own. NYIM defiantly knows what they are doing and how to work with an individual or company. Sincerely, Steve of Waken	Quark Private Training 	R.P.
The class was great!  The instructor (Joe) took his time and explained things very carefully.  It definitely helps to know what you want, but this class can at least show you what is possible, as well as how to be efficient and creative at the same time.  A+	InDesign Fundamentals Group Class 	I.P.

Tailored the class to our needs, very attentive.

I think that this was a really good class and I was very pleased with what I learned - - I think I'll feel very comfortable when I go back to my computer to work on my site.	Dreamweaver Essentials Group Class	B.J.
Nothing really. Joe was very helpful and the learn by doing approach is very practical. Now we can get started on our own site. We like that we can come back for additional classes later once we have more ideas for our own site. Nice to have the training CD for the future also.	Dreamweaver Essentials Group Class	H.O.
Kathi... good energy and knowledge of the subject matter. All sections were useful to me as I am a first time user and wanted to gain a general understanding of the program.

I think Mikelle was great.   A class of students with relatively the same experience on  Illustrator though, would use Mikelle's talents best; more advanced people won't feel hindered and those with less experience won't feel the class  moves too fast.	Dreamweaver Essentials Group Class	Lexus
Glenn H. is as exclusive as ever.  He is thoroughly  honest, impartial, sincere and a hard- working instructor.  If I came across any difficulty at all, it was my own weakness; his instructions were clear, precise and perfect, accommodative to all.  He did not care for his time; he cared more for his students' comprehension, and his satisfaction toward them. I appreciate his attitude, his perfection of the subject and his friendliness intermixed with his style of instructions. Please convey my best wishes to him.

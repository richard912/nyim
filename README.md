##### Development Use
As an plug-in alternative to MySql you can use MariaDb:
- much more performant
- doesn't require any changes
- proper security defaults

If mysql2 gem errors out during installation, provide this:
gem install mysql2 --with-mysql-dir=/PATH/TO/MARIADB/OR/MYSQL

Resseting root password for OSX, in case you forgot your root password:
https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-reset-your-mariadb-root-password/\


mysql.server start

CREATE USER rails WITH PASSWORD "rails";
CREATE DATABASE nyim3_development;

Don't use rake db:migrate, use rake db:schema:load to load up schema.

you may need to delete "System" file in Public folder


####To restart server
First have your public key installed by Viktor viktor.tron@gmail.com. It may be possible to add via github

ssh root@207.210.201.229
initctl start delayed_job
/etc/init/delayed_job.conf
ln -s /lib/init/upstart-job /etc/init.d/delayed_job

--needed?
ls -l /etc/init/delayed_job.conf
cat /etc/init/delayed_job.conf



This is antiquated. I think. 
ps auxwww | grep delayed_job | grep -v grep
killall svscan
/etc/init.d/nyim_service
ps auxwww | grep delayed_job | grep -v grep

Make sure to close the window and do nothing besides these commands

--
restarted apache with 
  sudo service httpd restart
check status with 
  sudo service httpd status

####Deploying

eval `ssh-agent `; ssh-add  ~/.ssh/id_rsa

grep 'send_trainer_class_reminders' /home/training/nyim/current/log/production.log

grep 'CourseReminders' /home/training/nyim/current/log/delayed_job.log


####Centos Release 6.6

/etc/httpd/conf/includes/*
Direct modifications to the Apache configuration file ma
y be lost upon subsequent regeneration of the configuration file. To have modifications retained, all
modifications must be checked into the configuration system by running:
/usr/local/cpanel/bin/apache_conf_distiller --update
To see if your changes will be conserved, regenerate the
Apache configuration file by running:              
/usr/local/cpanel/bin/build_apache_conf and check the configuration file for your alterations. If your changes have been ignored, then they will    
need to be added directly to their respective template files.

To customize this VirtualHost use an include file at the following location
Include "/usr/local/apache/conf/userdata/std/2/training/training-nyc.com/*.conf"

/home/training/www/training-nyc.com/shared/httpd.conf
 

This is how they fixed it when permssions were messed up.

The permissions for passenger were incorrect for those folders. We corrected them and the site is now working w/ the wildcard SSL. Can you confirm on your end as well?


# Process to add new user keys to server
ssh root@207.210.201.229
nano .ssh/authorized_keys

paste in the contents of the public key. It will look something like ""ssh-dss 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 eric@ekittell.com
